--SQL Execution Order:
--From/Join -> Where -> Group By -> Having -> Select -> Distinct -> Order By
--Select: required with fields or aggregate fields
--From: requires tables
--Where: optional for filtering
--Group By: optional with Aggregates but Aggregates are required for its usage
--Having: optional but should be used with Group By
--Order By: optional for sorting.

--Where and Having:
--1. Both are used as filters but having applies to groups and filters on aggreagate functions, but where applies to individual rows
--2. Where cannot filter by aggregate functions; however having can.
--3. Where can be used with Select, Update, Delete, but Having can only be used with Select

--Requirement
--Same number of Columns
--same data type associated with the column number
--Traits:
--Uses First select statement Alias

--Union vs Union All: 
--1. Union removes duplicates, union all will not
--2. Union the records from the first column is sorted automatically
--3. Unions cannot be used in recursive CTE, while Union All can

--Subqueries
--Select statement that is embedded in another query
Select * from Customers Where ContactName = 'Alejandra Camino'

Declare @CityFind varchar(40)

Select ContactName, City

Where City = @CityFind

Select ContactName, City
From Customers
Where City In (
Select City 
From Customers Where ContactName = 'Alejandra Camino')

--Find the city where Alejandra Camino
--Find other customers from the same city where Alejandra Camino lives

--Subqueries vs Joins:
--1. Joins can only be used in the from Clause, but subqueries can be used in Select, Where, Having, From, Order By clause

--List all the order data and the corresponding employee whose in charge of this order
--
Select * From orders
SELECT o.OrderDate, E.FirstName, E.LastName
FROM Orders o INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
WHERE e.City = 'London'
ORDER BY o.OrderDate, E.FirstName, E.LastName

--Subqueries: (To prove a point tthat subqueries can be used in Select, Where, and Order By in this situation)
SELECT o.OrderDate,
(SELECT e1.FirstName FROM Employees e1 WHERE o.EmployeeID = e1.EmployeeID) AS FirstName,
(SELECT e2.LastName FROM Employees e2 WHERE o.EmployeeID = e2.EmployeeID) AS LastName
FROM Orders o
WHERE (SELECT e3.City FROM Employees e3 WHERE o.EmployeeID = e3.EmployeeID) = 'London'
ORDER BY o.OrderDate,
(SELECT e1.FirstName FROM Employees e1 WHERE o.EmployeeID = e1.EmployeeID) ,

--Find customers who never placed any orders:
--Join
Select c.CustomerID, c.ContactName, c.City, c.Country

--Subquery version
Select c.CustomerID, c.ContactName, c.City, c.Country 
From Customers c
Where CustomerID not in (
Select distinct CustomerID From Orders)

--3. Joins will typically have better performance than subqueries
--Correlated Subquery: Subquery where inner query is dependant on the outer query
--Customer Name and total number of orders by Customer
